[![Dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-dev-blue.svg)](https://fernandopenaranda.github.io/Non_linear-optics_in_TBG.dev)

For the sake of reproducibility, we show in this repo: the code, the data files, and the plotting functions used to generate the figures in our work: *Magnetic injection photocurrents in valley polarized states of twisted bilayer graphene* [arXiv:2501.09703](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.09703)

Remarks:  

0. All the code provided here is written in Julia (v1.0 >)
1. Data files used to build each figure can be either directly accessed at `Non_linear-optics_in_TBG/data` or generated using the Non_linear-optics_in_TBG/src/Paper/paper_figures.ipynb file that also contains the plotting functions used in the main and supplementary sections

## Installation

In a Julia terminal: 
```
